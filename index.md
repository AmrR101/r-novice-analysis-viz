The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to R is built around a common scientific task:
data analysis.

Our real goal isn't to teach you R,
but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.
We use R in our lessons because:

1.  we have to use *something* for examples;
2.  it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
3.  it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and
4.  it has a large library of external packages available for performing diverse tasks.

But the two most important things are to use whatever language your
colleagues are using, so you can share your work with them easily, and
to use that language *well*.

Our goal is to be able to

- Read data into R
- Make useful visualisations
- Perform common data analysis tasks
- Learn how to find packages that simplify your work

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory).  We use RStudio to teach this
> lesson but it is not strictly required if you prefer some other way
> of interacting with R. Check that your installation is sufficient by
> calling `source("https://goo.gl/J8gVWx")`in R.
